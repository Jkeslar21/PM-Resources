## Daily Work FLow


Alright guys, I just wanted to be sure we all know what we are working on today after lunch. 

You will be working on the assignment listed in the TK under projects(UI-I). Once you have completed all of the 
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) goals you can go ahead and move on to completing the stretch goals. 

(These are reflected in your daily Standup Reports in the 3 star grading system check the tables below)


If you wish to _Demonstrate Your Mastery_ you are encouraged to attempt the additional assignments in that section on the bottom 
of the Module in the TK(I know we already discussed this). I would like to reiterate that neither the _stretch_ nor the 
_Demonstrate Mastery_ are required, but very highly recommended. (Don't forget these are designed to test your knowledge, 
and are not based on the days material, but independent research to be done on your own to complete.)
